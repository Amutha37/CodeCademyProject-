// Sometimes you will want a class to have methods that aren’t available in individual instances, but that you can call directly from the class.

// Take the Date class, for example — you can both create Date instances to represent whatever date you want, and call static methods, like Date.now() which returns the current date, directly from the class. The .now() method is static, so you can call it directly from the class, but not from an instance of the class.

// Inside of your HospitalEmployee class, create a static method called generatePassword. When it’s called, this method should return a random integer between zero and 10,000.

  }
  static generatePassword() {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000);
