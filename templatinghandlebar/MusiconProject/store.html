    <!-- below is step to  change the template so main.js handles the template html  -->
    <!-- Now it’s time to replace some hard coded values with Handlebars expressions. Change the value of the src and alt attribute within the <img> tag with a {{this.image}} and {{this.name}} expression respectively. -->

    <!-- Replace the contents inside the .name, .description, .price and .sale elements with Handlebar expressions. Use the following expressions in their respective fields: {{this.name}}, {{this.description}}, {{this.price}} and {{this.sale}}. -->

    <!-- You might notice some instruments are on sale and others are not. You can account for this using a built-in Handlebars block helper, {{if}}, which acts like the if conditional in JavaScript.

Use the {{if}} block helper to display the on-sale price. If the this.sale property is truthy, you should also display the <p> elements that have the classes price, sale and deal. Add an {{else}} section, in case this.sale is falsy, to display the this.price element (without the nested <del> tag). -->

    <!-- Now, locate the #showcase element. In the <section> that has a class of container, add an id of information. Since you don’t need the hard coded values anymore, delete the all the elements that have a class of instrument.

The #information <section> should be empty but the web page should still be filled with instruments! -->

    <!-- Great, you refactored your code to use Handlebars. Take advantage of your set up template to add a new instrument to Musicon!

Add another object in the instruments array that has the following properties:

Set the image property to be 'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-handlebars/musicon/violin.png'.
Set the name property to be 'Violin'.
Set the description property to be 'A versatile that is suited for any and all occasions. Those wearing tuxedos can strum together a classic. Others who prefer overalls can call it a fiddle and play some folk songs.'.
Set the price property to be '$245.00'.
After creating the object successfully, save your progress. You will see the violin added to the store page. -->
    <!-- for more challenge  -->

    <!-- Great work! The home and store pages look leagues better than when you started. 
      
      If you want to challenge yourself, consider:

Add/Remove instruments to the store.
Change the overall layout of the website.
Create additional styling in public/style.css.
Add and link to an additional page for Musicon. -->
